**Introduction**
This project implements a seamless CI/CD pipeline to automate the daily backup process and deployment. It integrates various DevOps tools to handle backups efficiently, ensuring that data is regularly backed up and available for restoration as needed.

**Technologies Used**
Git: Version control system for managing project codebase.
GitHub: Hosts the Git repository and enables collaboration.
Jenkins: Automation server for orchestrating CI/CD pipelines.
Terraform: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool for provisioning and managing infrastructure.
Ansible: Configuration management tool used to automate server setup and configuration.
Features
Automated Daily Backups: Scheduled backups ensure data is backed up daily without manual intervention.
CI/CD Pipeline: Streamlined pipeline automates backup processes from Git repository to cloud storage.
Infrastructure as Code: Infrastructure provisioning and configuration managed through Terraform and Ansible.
Data Integrity: Ensures data integrity and availability by regularly backing up critical data.
Scalability: Easily scalable to handle growing data volumes and backup requirements.
Installation
To set up and use this project, follow these steps:

**Clone the Repository:
**
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/automated-daily-backup.git
cd automated-daily-backup
Configure Jenkins:

Install Jenkins and set up required plugins.
Configure Jenkins credentials for GitHub, Docker Hub, etc.
Create a Jenkins pipeline to automate the backup process.
Configure Terraform:

Install Terraform and configure AWS credentials.
Write Terraform configuration files (*.tf) to define infrastructure (e.g., EC2 instances, S3 buckets).
Configure Ansible:

Install Ansible on the Jenkins server.
Write Ansible playbooks (*.yml) to configure servers (e.g., install backup scripts, set up cron jobs).
Schedule Daily Backup:

Use Jenkins to schedule the backup job to run daily.
Ensure the backup script handles incremental backups and storage management efficiently.
Usage
Running the Automated Backup
Trigger Jenkins Pipeline:

Manually trigger the Jenkins pipeline or schedule it to run daily.
Jenkins pipeline fetches the latest code from GitHub, executes Terraform to provision infrastructure, and uses Ansible to configure servers.
Monitor Backup Process:

Monitor Jenkins console output for backup status and logs.
Review backup artifacts stored in specified storage (e.g., AWS S3 bucket).
